## Git
Git is a free software that helps you keep track of different versions of your work. Imagine writing a poem, then saving different drafts so you can go back to an earlier version if needed. Git does this automatically.It helps you remember every change you make, so you don’t lose your progress and can compare different versions easily.

## GitHub
GitHub is a website where you can store your Git projects online. Think of it as a social network for your work. You can upload your poems, stories, or projects and share them with others or keep them safe in the cloud. It makes your work accessible from anywhere and allows others to see or collaborate on your projects.

## Repository (or Repo)
A repository is like a folder or a project space on GitHub. It holds all your files related to a specific project, like a poem about rainbows. You create a repository called "Rainbow Poem" to store your poem files and history.

## Commit
A commit is like saving a version of your work with a note about what you changed. It’s similar to clicking "Save" but with extra details. It records every change you make, so you can look back at any point and see what was different or restore an earlier version if needed.
